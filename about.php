<h2>Hey.</h2>

<p>My name is <strong>Sanjay rathore</strong> and I am a <strong>web developer</strong> .</p>

<p>I <strong>started</strong> with a small <strong>side project</strong> at the <strong>beginning of 2017</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I started this website with&nbsp;<strong>a simple aim</strong>:&nbsp;to release <strong>Bootstrap templates I had in my drawer</strong>, for free. After some time, I started to get quite many &quot;Thank you&quot; emails, in fact so many that it made me build new&nbsp;templates, created primarily&nbsp;to be published on Bootstrapious only.</p>

<p>This also quite naturally lead to Bootstrapious tutorials and I can say that this is how Bootstrapious generally looks like today.</p>

<p>You will find here <strong>a collection of exclusive Bootstrap templates</strong> and <strong>insightful Bootstrap tutorials</strong>, along with articles about latest design trends or tools.</p>

<p>As Bootstrapious is still a hobby project only, I would be grateful if you could check out my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bootstrapious" rel="nofollow">Patreon page</a> or support Bootstrapious by <a href="https://bootstrapious.com/donate">buying a non-attribution license</a> for my templates. <strong>Your contributions help me a lot</strong> to get Bootstrapious a bit further on our journey.</p>

<p><strong>Have a great day,</strong></p>

<p>thanks for reading :)</p>

<p><strong>Ondrej</strong></p>
